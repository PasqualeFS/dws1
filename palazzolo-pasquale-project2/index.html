			<p>Buona sera, Signori, Signorina and to the little bambine. Our family wants nothing more than to see a full belly when you
				visit us and a warm heart as you say arrivederci. When you step into Pasquale's and the aroma hits you square in the nose, you
				know you're in for a treat drenched in tradition and family history.</p>

			<div id="story">
				<h2 class="sectionSubtitle">Storia a La Famiglia</h2>
				<p>We came to America on the boat (well...almost). Truth is that grandpa jumped ship a mile out from Ellis and swam ashore making a name for himself as one of New York's barbers. He cut hair in the town by day and then he put on a suit after dinner each night, grabbed his <q><strong>good</strong></q> barber's tools and went out and cut hair privately for the...shall we say...made men.</p>

				<p>That's not really where the focus of our story lies. While grandpa <abbr title="Palazzolo">P.</abbr> spruced up Michael, Luca, Vito and friends, Agostina stayed home and did the cooking.  We left family behind in Sicilia but, what we took with us was what sparked traditions here in the <abbr title="United States of America">U.S.A.</abbr> We brought treasures that would line the table each evening at supper. Eight people came to dine but Grandma Agostina cooked for an army.  <q>MANGIA!</q>, she'd yell. We knew we had to eat more than our stomachs felt like they could hold.</p>

				<p>Two decades have passed since Agostina went home to heaven but her legacy lives on in the food we make here at Pasquale's. We have not sacrificed quality ingredients, quantity or time.  The food that sits before you on your plate was made with the same love, dedication and sweat that grandma and grandpa spent to keep our family together. So fill your stomachs and when you think you can't handle another bite, listen quietly and you may hear grandma yell <q>Mangia</q> to you.</p>

				<p>From our family to yours, we hope you enjoy. We hope you return for more.</p>
